## Weapons carried by enemies analyser

This simple tool calculates how many enemies use the same weapon in the map of Breath of the Wild. Can be used with maps from mods too. To use, simply launch main.py.  
You also can calculate this with trials of the sword map - just copy the content of the AocField folder into MainField.
